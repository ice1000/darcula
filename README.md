This is just a copy of [bulenkov/Darcula](https://github.com/bulenkov/Darcula) (which is not hosted on any maven repository),
but I've replaced some icons with the newest IntelliJ icons.

Used in [ice1000/dev-kt](https://github.com/ice1000/dev-kt).

# Build

Gradle:

```
repositories { jcenter() }
dependencies { compile 'com.bulenkov:darcula:2018.2' }
```
